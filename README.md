# Classification-using-TFIDF-and-RF
Steps for classification: 
Step1: text preproceesing and EDA
Step2: convert text to number i.e. vectorizing the text (earlier tfidf, countvectorizer now elmo, bert etc)
Step3 : model definition: earlier we used logistic regression, random forest, Naive Bayes etc now we use deep learning models especially sequential deep learning models
Step4: Fit the model with training data
Step5: Validation of the model
Step6: Fine tune the model
