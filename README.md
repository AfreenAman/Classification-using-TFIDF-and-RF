# Classification-using-TFIDF-and-RF
Steps for classification: 
- text preproceesing and EDA
- convert text to number i.e. vectorizing the text (earlier tfidf, countvectorizer now elmo, bert etc)
- model definition: earlier we used logistic regression, random forest, Naive Bayes etc now we use deep learning models especially sequential deep learning models
- Fit the model with training data
- Validation of the model
- Fine tune the model
